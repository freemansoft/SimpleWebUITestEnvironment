This Specflow Test project exists to use BDD to test search engines web functionality.

It mimics the API BDD scenarios

Uses NUnit.  Note the actual testing framework is completely isolated from the developer if they use Fluent Assertions because the test framework code is all autogenerated by Specflow.
